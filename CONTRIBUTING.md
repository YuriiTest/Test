## JBS package
'JBS' is an abbreviation so I decided to deviate from the guidelines and leave this name in uppercase. 
## templatetags package
According to guidelines, this package should be named as 'template_tags'. But, as written in Django documentation:
> The app should contain a templatetags directory, at the same level as models.py, views.py, etc. 
> Your custom tags and filters will live in a module inside the **templatetags** directory.
